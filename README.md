## Overview

![screenshot](/screenshot.png)

- My experience?
  This was easy to at first but i realized when it came to adding the rotated role text,
  it was not just position and rotate. 
- What have I learned/improved?
  I could just use the `rotate` property instead of `transform: rotate();`
- My wisdom? :I
  Try to using `transform` more often instead of `margin` to move elements or groups of elements, it can make things easier when planning to add some more stuff.
